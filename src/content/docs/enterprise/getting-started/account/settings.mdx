## My Rate Templates

On the **My rate templates** page, you can create and manage personal templates for report settings. These templates are visible only in your profile and can be used when generating **Cost Estimate** and **Translation Cost** reports.

Each template can include:

* **Base rates** – Set rates for full translation and proofreading. Applied to all languages by default.
* **Net Rate Schemes** – Set percentage rates for TM, MT, AI, and other match types, based on the full translation rate.
* **Custom rates** – Add language-specific (and in some cases, user-specific) rate configurations.
* **Additional options** – Include or exclude pre-translated strings, adjust how repetitive translations are categorized, and calculate internal fuzzy matches.

Saved templates help standardize your rate setup and make it easy to reuse configurations across reports. To use a saved template, click **Templates** when configuring your report and select the one you'd like to apply.

To create a new rate template, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Account Settings > My rate templates**.
  2. Click **Add Rates Template**.
  3. Enter a template name and define your base rates and net rate schemes.
  4. *(Optional)* Add custom rates for specific languages.
  5. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

## Security

Change your current password, manage two-factor authentication for the Account, and check linked applications. You can also control authentication for external services and log out of all the devices.

### Password

To change your password, click **Password**, enter your current password, and set a new one. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

### Authenticator App

Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security to your Crowdin Enterprise account. Use an authenticator app on your mobile device or computer to generate one-time verification codes.

To enable two-factor authentication, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and select **Security** on the left sidebar.
  2. Click **Authenticator app**.
  3. Using the **Google Authenticator** app on your mobile device, scan the QR code on the screen.
  4. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by your authenticator app, then click **Submit**.
  5. Download recovery codes, so you can use them if you can't access your mobile device.
</Steps>

### Connected Applications

Manage third-party apps you've authorized to access your Crowdin Enterprise account. You can view a list of connected apps and revoke access as needed.

### Security Keys and Passkey

Register a physical security key or passkey to strengthen your account protection. These can be used alongside your password to verify your identity during login.

### Device Verification

Enable **Device Verification** to require identity confirmation when logging in from a new device. A verification code will be sent to your registered email address, and the device will be added to your trusted list once verified.

<Aside>
  You can disable this option only if at least one 2FA method (such as the Authenticator app or a security key) is enabled.
</Aside>

You can manage trusted devices by removing individual entries or clicking **Remove All** to clear the list.

### Auth Providers

Manage external accounts linked to your Crowdin Enterprise account. You can connect services like Google, Facebook, GitHub, X, or GitLab to enable one-click login.

### Security Log

View a list of important account events, such as logins, password changes, authentication updates, and more. Each entry includes the event type, device, IP address, and timestamp.

### Sessions

View a list of devices that have accessed your Crowdin Enterprise account, along with details like location, last activity, IP address, and device type. You can revoke individual sessions or click **Revoke All** to end all sessions except the current one.

### Sudo Mode

Crowdin Enterprise may ask you to confirm your password before performing sensitive actions, such as changing your password, email, or authentication settings. Once verified, you’ll stay in sudo mode for five minutes without needing to re-authenticate.

On the **Notifications** page, you can customize which notifications you receive and how they are delivered. You can choose delivery channels, select relevant events, and apply project-level preferences.

### Channels & Events

Crowdin Enterprise provides several channels for notifications:

* In-App (Crowdin Enterprise)
* Email
* Slack
* Custom Notifications

To customize notifications, click the arrow next to a channel name and select the events you want to be notified about.

Available notification events include:
